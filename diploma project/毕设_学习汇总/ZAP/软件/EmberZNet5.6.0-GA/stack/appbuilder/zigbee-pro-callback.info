/**@brief A callback invoked by the EmberZNet stack to filter out incoming
 * application MAC passthrough messages.  If this returns TRUE for a message
 * the complete message will be passed to emberMacPassthroughMessageHandler()
 * with a type of EMBER_MAC_PASSTHROUGH_APPLICATION.
 *
 * Note that this callback may be invoked in ISR context and should execute as
 * quickly as possible.
 *
 * Note that this callback may be called more than once per incoming message.  
 * Therefore the callback code should not depend on being called only once,
 * and should return the same value each time it is called with a given header.
 *
 * If the application includes this callback, it must define
 * EMBER_APPLICATION_HAS_MAC_PASSTHROUGH_FILTER_HANDLER in its
 * CONFIGURATION_HEADER.
 *
 * @param macHeader        A pointer to the initial portion of the
 *     incoming MAC header.  This contains the MAC frame control and
 *     addressing fields.  Subsequent MAC fields, and the MAC payload,
 *     may not be present.
 * @return TRUE if the messages is an application MAC passthrough message.
