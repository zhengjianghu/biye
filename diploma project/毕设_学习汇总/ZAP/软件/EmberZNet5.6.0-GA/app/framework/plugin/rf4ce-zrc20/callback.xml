  <function id="ACTION" name="Action" returnType="void">
    <description>
      This function is called by the RF4CE ZRC 2.0 plugin when an action starts or stops.  If the action type of the action record is ::EMBER_AF_RF4CE_ZRC_ACTION_TYPE_START, the application should execute the requested operation repeatedly at some application-specific rate.  When the repetition should stop, the plugin will call the callback again with the action type set to ::EMBER_AF_RF4CE_ZRC_ACTION_TYPE_STOP.  ::EMBER_AF_RF4CE_ZRC_ACTION_TYPE_REPEAT is a special case of ::EMBER_AF_RF4CE_ZRC_ACTION_TYPE_START and means that the start action from the originator was not received and that the originator is still triggering the action.  The application should process a repeat type the same as a start type, but may wish to perform additional operations to compensate for missed actions.  If the action type is ::EMBER_AF_RF4CE_ZRC_ACTION_TYPE_ATOMIC, the application should execute the operation once.  The plugin will not call the callback again for an atomic action.
