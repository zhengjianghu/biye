name=Network Steering

description=This plugin will perform the necesary steps to join the network of any ZigBee Profile.  It tries first to perform a join using an install code using the Primary Channel Mask, and then the secondary channel mask.  If that does not work it then tries to use the default well-known link key (ZigBeeAlliance09) to join on the primary channel maks, and then the secondary channel mask. The ZigBee specification on which this is based is still in development, and thus the functionality and implementation contained in this plugin may be subject to change until the specification is completed.
