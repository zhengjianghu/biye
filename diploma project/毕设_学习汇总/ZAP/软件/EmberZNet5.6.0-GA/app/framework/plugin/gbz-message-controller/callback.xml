      This function is called by the Gbz Message Controller plugin to decrypt a ZCL payload. If the decryption is successful, the application is responsible for allocating the memory for the new decrypted data and passing the pointer via the "plainData" field as well as the plainDataLength field for the length. The framework will be responsible for free-ing the allocated memory. If the decryption fails, the callback return FALSE and should not modify any data.
